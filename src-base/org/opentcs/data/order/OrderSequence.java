/**
 * Describes a process spanning multiple transport orders which are to be
 * executed one after the other by the same vehicle.
 * <p>
 * The most important rules for <code>OrderSequence</code> processing are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Only <code>TransportOrder</code>s that have not yet been activated may be
 * added to an <code>OrderSequence</code>. Allowing them to be added at a later
 * point of time would imply that, due to concurrency in the kernel, a transport
 * order might happen to be dispatched at the same time or shortly after it is
 * added to a sequence, regardless of if its predecessors in the sequence have
 * already been finished or not.</li>
 * <li>The <em>intendedVehicle</em> of a <code>TransportOrder</code> being added
 * to an <code>OrderSequence</code> must be the same as that of the sequence
 * itself. If it is <code>null</code> in the sequence (and the orders belonging
 * to it), a vehicle that will process all orders in the sequence will be chosen
 * automatically once the first order in the sequence is dispatched.</li>
 * <li>If an <code>OrderSequence</code> is marked as <em>complete</em> and all
 * <code>TransportOrder</code>s belonging to it have arrived in state
 * <code>FINISHED</code> or <code>FAILED</code>, it will be marked as
 * <em>finished</em> implicitly.
 * <li>If a <code>TransportOrder</code> belonging to an
 * <code>OrderSequence</code> fails and the sequence's <em>failureFatal</em>
 * flag is set, all subsequent orders in the sequence will automatically be
 * considered (and marked as) failed, too, and the order sequence will
 * implicitly be marked as <em>complete</em> (and <em>finished</em>).</li>
 * <li>If an <code>OrderSequence</code> is removed from the kernel, the
 * contained <code>TransportOrder</code>s will remain in the kernel (with their
 * references on the wrapping sequence cleared) and may be dispatched to
 * vehicles.</li>
 * <li>If a <code>TransportOrder</code> belonging to an
 * <code>OrderSequence</code> is removed from the kernel, the reference on it in
 * the sequence will be removed as well without any further action. (This
 * behaviour is likely to change in future versions.)</li>
 * </ul>
