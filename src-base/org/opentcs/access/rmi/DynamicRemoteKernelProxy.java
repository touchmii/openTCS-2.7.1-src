/**
 * Creates proxies that hide the details of communication with a remote kernel,
 * so a client can call methods of the proxy as if it was a local kernel
 * instance.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the kernel you want to connect to is running on the same system as your
 * client, you usually only have to do the following:
 * <pre>
 * Kernel kernel = DynamicRemoteKernelProxy.getProxy("localhost",
 *                                                   AllOrNothingTCSEventFilter.acceptingInstance);
 * </pre>
 * You can then use <code>kernel</code> to call methods on the proxy, which
 * will be wrapped by RMI calls internally and forwarded to the kernel you
 * connected to. This interface to the kernel can e.g. be used to create
 * transport orders from clients - see the package documentation for
 * {@link org.opentcs.data.order} for some code examples.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The proxy will immediately start polling periodically for
 * events with the remote kernel; you can use custom intervals and timeouts for
 * polling by calling one of the other <code>getProxy()</code> methods. Using
 * {@link org.opentcs.util.eventsystem.AllOrNothingTCSEventFilter#acceptingInstance AllOrNothingTCSEventFilter.acceptingInstance}
 * as its event filter as shown above will let the proxy receive every event
 * generated inside the kernel without filtering out any of them. To receive all
 * or some of these events in your own code, register an event listener with the
 * proxy by calling its
 * {@link org.opentcs.util.eventsystem.EventSource#addEventListener(org.opentcs.util.eventsystem.EventListener, org.opentcs.util.eventsystem.EventFilter) addEventListener()}
 * method; the proxy will then forward all events that it received and that are
 * not filtered by your event filter to your registered listener.
 * </p>
